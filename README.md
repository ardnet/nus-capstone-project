## Capstone Project | NUS-Emeritus:
Analysing Data on Credit Card Customers to Develop Machine Learning Models Using Python.

## Overview:
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict credit card default payment behavior. The dataset contains various features related to demographic information, payment history, and financial details. The goal is to build and evaluate machine learning models, including logistic regression, random forests, and deep learning models, to predict whether a customer will default on their credit card payment in the subsequent month.

## Project Components:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Loaded and cleaned the dataset (`CC_Default.csv`) containing 25 columns such as age, payment history, bill amount, and payment amount.
   - Applied necessary transformations, handled missing values, and ensured the data was ready for analysis.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conducted a thorough analysis to understand the patterns and relationships between variables.
   - Visualized data distributions and correlations using libraries like `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, and `plotly`.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Performed feature selection and extraction to improve model performance.
   - Used statistical methods to check for multicollinearity and other potential issues in the dataset.

4. **Model Building**:
   - Implemented machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict the likelihood of default.
   - Tuned hyperparameters and compared model performance based on metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrix.

5. **Deep Learning Approach**:
   - Developed a neural network model using `TensorFlow` and `Keras` to predict payment defaults.
   - Evaluated the model's performance and compared it with traditional machine learning models.

6. **Results and Evaluation**:
   - Provided detailed results and analysis of model performance.
   - Presented key metrics such as confusion matrix, classification report, and feature importance.

## Technologies Used:
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
